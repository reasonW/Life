#Conveyor belt monitoring target detection
> This project is my Curriculum design code.<br>
My task is detect the outlier on the conveyor belt working in a ore-dressing plant to avoid dangers.

>My analysis is that the characteristic of this kind of video is background is relatively fixedï¼Œ<br>
but jitter is more serious. The direction of the conveyor belt is fixed, movement characteristics significantly.

>I try to process it by optical,then I can select the fixed direction of the conveyor belt transmission.<br>
After this ,I could segmented it by the scale and the speed of piece.
